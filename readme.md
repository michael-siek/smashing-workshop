# Milestone III: Enter axe (pro)

Let's run axe pro on our broken build and see what we can find and fix.

## State #1: default state

Axe gives us several color contrast issues and a bunch of image alt issues. Looking back on our wireframes, let's mark these images up properly and update the text color of "Beginner" to get our desired axe clean (0 violations)!

Lets save our results and run the following tools:

- page info
- images
- headings
- buttons and links

## State #2: view recipe modal

- Axe gives us a single new issue: "Form elements must have labels"

- **solution**: associate the visible label ("Rate the yumminess (0 - 50)") with the form field.
- save results and run the forms tool and see if we can catch anything else!

## State #3: edit recipe modal

- we've got axe clean!!! but we're not done yet :)
- run the buttons and links tool and fix associated issues
- run the forms tool on **1** of the form fields
